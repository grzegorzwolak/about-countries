Hi,
welcome to my project repository. I hope you like the result of my work. Below you will find a link so you can view it conveniently. During the creation of this application I used:

- HTML, CSS,
- JS,
- RESTCountries API - https://restcountries.com/

This application downloads data from RESTCountries using the API and dynamically creates country cards. The user can use the search engine to find the country of interest.
